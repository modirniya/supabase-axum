## Development Rules

- **Strict Adherence**: All implementations must strictly adhere to the definitions and guidelines provided within this document.
- **No Undefined Features**: Do not implement features, functionalities, or entities that are not explicitly described in this plan.
- **Faithfulness to Plan**: The developmental process shall remain faithful to this DEV-PLAN at all times, unless explicitly overridden by a user request.
- **AI Guidance**: Placeholders within project files should contain clear instructions to guide the AI in implementing specific functionalities.
- **Open-Closed Principle**: Design components to be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Loose Coupling**: Favor loosely-coupled dependencies to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the codebase.
- **Iterative Builds**: The project must be built repeatedly after each development iteration to catch build errors as early as possible.
- **Version Control Initialization**: A Git repository and corresponding GitHub repository must be created at the initiation of the project.
- **Gitignore Vigilance**: Regularly check the .gitignore file to ensure sensitive information does not leave the local development machine.
- **Automated Commits**: Each commit must be performed automatically after each successful build.
- **Manual Push**: Pushing to the remote repository will remain upon user request.
- **Rust Edition**: Rust will use the 2024 edition.
